        <p>My second semester began with a trip throughout the south of Israel and then transitioned to the main focus of volunteering in a city in Israel. My program split between two cities where we each had a different volunteer job throughout the city. I lived in Teveria, in the north of Israel, and volunteered at a Gan (a preschool) and an after-care center for at-risk youth. In Teveria, I lived in an apartment with nine other girls on my program and volunteered. My second semester was unfortunately cut short due to COVID and I only spent three full weeks volunteering. Throughout this time, I traveled throughout Israel and visited different cities for holidays. </p>
